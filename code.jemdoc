- [https://github.com/lttam/UnbalancedSobolevTransport Unbalanced Sobolev Transport (UST)]. (AISTATS 2023)
-- A scalable variant of unbalanced optimal transport for measures supported on a graph metric space.
-- (i) closed-form expression for fast computation; (ii) negative definite metric which allows to build positive definite kernels.
-- Note 1: The standard (Balanced) Sobolev Transport (AISTATS 2022) is a special case of UST (when input measures have the same mass).
-- Note 2: A variant distance of Entropy Partial Transport (AISTATS 2021) is a special case of UST (when input measures are supported on a tree metric space and UST with length measure and its order is equal to one). 
- [https://github.com/lttam/SobolevTransport Sobolev Transport (ST)]. (AISTATS 2022)
-- A scalable variant of optimal transport for probability measures supported on a graph metric space.
-- (i) closed-form expression for fast computation; (ii) negative definite metric which allows to build positive definite kernels.
-- Note: Tree Wasserstein (NeurIPS 2019) is a special case of ST (when input measures are supported in a tree metric space).
- [https://github.com/lttam/Adversarial-Regression Adversarial Regression with Doubly Non-negative Weighting Matrices]. (NeurIPS 2021)
-- An adversarial regression (e.g., for Nadaraya-Watson, for locally linear regression, for support vector regression).
-- Implemented by TL and Viet Anh Nguyen.
- [https://github.com/lttam/EntropyPartialTransport Entropy Partial Transport with Tree Metric]. (AISTATS 2021)
-- An unbalanced version of Tree-(Sliced)-Wasserstein for probability measures with different total mass.
-- A valid positive definite kernel for persistence diagrams (which can have different numbers of topological features, e.g., connected components, rings).
- [https://github.com/lttam/FlowBasedAlignment-GW Flow-based Alignment Approaches for Probability Measures in Different Spaces]. (AISTATS 2021)
-- A variant of Gromov-Wasserstein with tree metrics.
- [https://github.com/lttam/TW_NAS Optimal Transport Kernels for Sequential and Parallel Neural Architecture Search]. (ICML 2021)
-- Implemented by Vu Nguyen. (Partially by TL --  tree-Wasserstein for neural networks)
- [https://github.com/lttam/LSMI-Sinkhorn LSMI-Sinkhorn]. (ECML-PKDD 2021)
-- Implemented by Yanbin Liu and Makoto Yamada.
- [https://github.com/lttam/TreeWasserstein Tree-(Sliced)-Wasserstein Distances]. (NeurIPS 2019)

- [https://github.com/lttam/safe_grid_search Safe Grid Search with Optimal Complexity]. (ICML 2019)
-- Implemented by Eugene Ndiaye.
- [https://github.com/lttam/PersistenceFisher Persistence Fisher distance with or without Fast Gauss Transform]. (NeurIPS/NIPS 2018)
-- Fisher information metric between two persistence diagrams.

- [https://sites.google.com/site/lttamvn/research/object-category Hierarchical Spatial Matching Kernel for Image Categorization]. (ICIAR 2011 & IIEEJ 2013)
- [https://sites.google.com/site/lttamvn/research/traffic-sign-detection Realtime traffic sign detection using color and shape-based features]. (ACIIDS 2010)
- [https://sites.google.com/site/lttamvn/research/traffic-sign-detection Color Training Dataset for Traffic Sign Segmentation]. (ACIIDS 2010)
