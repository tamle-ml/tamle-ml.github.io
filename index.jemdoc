#My research aims to make AI more advanced, with a focus on improving its scalability, efficiency, and robustness for learning with large-scale, complex data and models from mathematical perspectives, in particular /optimal transport (OT) theory/. More specially, I have been pursuing two main objectives as follows:
#.. Designing innovative, and efficient methodologies, e.g., for data valuation, LLM pretraining, diffusion models, generative models.
#I also actively expand the research to interesting and impactful (related) problems.
#.. Going beyond Lp geometric structure for variational Wasserstein problems, e.g., with functional geometric structure.
#.. Centering on applications with large-scale, complex structured data, e.g., non-Euclidean, dynamic, nonlinearity, corruption, perturbation.
###My research aims to make AI more advanced, with a focus on improving its scalability, efficiency, and robustness for learning with large-scale, complex data and models from mathematical perspectives, in particular /optimal transport (OT) theory/. More specially, my current interests are as follows:
###. Deepening OT theory: 
###.. Breaking the curse-of-dimensionality for OT with projected 1D-structure, e.g., with graph structure, tree system.
###.. Going beyond Lp structure for variational Wasserstein problems, e.g., with functional geometric structure.
###. Leveraging OT theoretical insights for AI: 
###.. Designing efficient methodologies, e.g., for data valuation, LLM pretraining, diffusion models, generative models.
###.. Centering on applications with large-scale, complex structured data, e.g., non-Euclidean, dynamic, nonlinearity, corruption.
