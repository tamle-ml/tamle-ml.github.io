Research: machine learning, optimal transport. \n

I have been working on theory, methodology, and application of learning with large-scale, complex data and models from mathematical perspectives. More concretely, my recent research includes:
- *Theory*: optimal transport theory for measures with graph structure, for variants with functional geometric structure.
- *Methodology*: scalability, robustness, and efficiency of optimal transport for learning with measures in machine learning and deep learning, including deep generative models, diffusion models, data valuation for LLM pretraining.
- *Application*: for domains with large-scale, complex structure data, including non-Euclidean, high-dimension, nonlinearity, corruption. 

I would love to expand my research spectrum to more interesting and impactful (related) research problems.

#I received my Ph.D. in 11/2005 from Ecole des Mines de Paris. Before that I graduated from the ENSAE with a master degree from ENS Cachan. I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo, between 11/2005 and 03/2007. Between 04/2007 and 09/2008 I worked in the financial industry. After working at the ORFE department of Princeton University between 02/2009 and 08/2010 as a lecturer, I was at the Graduate School of Informatics of Kyoto University between 09/2010 and 09/2016 as an associate professor (tenured in 11/2013). I have joined ENSAE in 09/2016, working there part-time from 10/2018. Between 10/2018 and 01/2022 I was with the Google Brain team. I joined Apple on 01/2022, working in the Machine Learning Research team led by Samy Bengio.
